This package has been made to compare some graph embedding algorithms.
The following methods are implemented:
Laplacian EigenMaps, Locally Linear Embedding, Higher-Order Proximity preserved Embedding (HOPE), Multi-dimensional scaling of a dissimilarity matrix,
Node2vec, Struc2vec, Verse, Singular Value Decomposition of the Adjacency matrix, Kamada-Kawai Layout (KKL), Structural Deep Network Embedding (SDNE)







Requirements: 


Python3: click, numpy, scipy, networkx, collections, sklearn, pandas, keras, tensorflow, python-igraph, graph_tool, python-louvain

Python2: futures, fastdtw, gensim

java: version 8 update 201

Snap (node2vec): download and compile Snap. Put node2vec executable in the corresponding directory and give it the right to execute (chmod +x)
